# Data Structure Learning Tool

An interactive web-based tool to visualize and analyze the behavior and performance of fundamental data structures — **Stack**, **Queue**, and **Linked List**. Designed for learners, educators, and system designers, this tool bridges the gap between theoretical complexity analysis and real-world runtime performance.

# Features

Interactive Operations**: Insert, delete, and search elements in stack, queue, and linked list.
Predicted vs. Actual Performance: Displays theoretical time complexity (Big-O) and measures actual execution time in milliseconds.
Real-Time Visualization: Dynamic rendering of data structure states after each operation.
Educational Insight: Helps users understand how data structure choices impact performance and memory.
Overwriting Performance Log: Only the most recent operation is logged to keep feedback focused and clear.
